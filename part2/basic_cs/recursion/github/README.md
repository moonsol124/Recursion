A small repo created to practice recursion.
The tasks are part of a basic CS course from The Odin Project.

Task1. Return an array of fibonacci numbers when an input is given using recursion.
Task2. Create a merge sort using recursion.

Notes:
1. Merge sort doesn't work with duplicates at the moment!
